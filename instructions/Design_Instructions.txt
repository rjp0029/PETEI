# Lines that start with '#' are treated as comments by the parser and ignored.
# Blank lines are also ignored. Each command has a key phrase separated from the
# information by a colon (:).

# Instruction files are provided to Designer.py as command-line arguments. An
# example command to run this file would be:
# python3 Designer.py ./instructions/Design_Instructions.txt overwrite
# The use of overwrite is OPTIONAL. The default is to not include it, but when
# it is included it will cause PETEI to delete any existing results with the
# same name as the one provided in the instruction file and overwrite them 
# with newly calculated results.

# General information

# The name of the calculations
Name: FLAG

# Who is doing the calculations
User: Robert Pantazes of Auburn University

# The database to use for the design
Database: 1TTGu

# The maximum number of successful designs for PETEI to generate. 
Maximum Designs: 50000

# The minimum number of targeted exceptional interations for a solution to be 
# successful. 4 was found to work well with the cutoff of 0.33 Angstroms for the
# fibronectin calculations.
Minimum Interactions: 4

# The file (including the path to find it as part of the file name) of the
# protein that should be bound. This must be PDB formatted information with all
# atoms (including hydrogens) present.
Antigen File: structures/5cxv_FLAG_minimized.pdb

# Epitope residues are the residues in the antigen that PETEI should target.
# Each entry must include two pieces of information: the chain of the protein
# and the residue number.
Epitope Residue: C 1
Epitope Residue: C 2
Epitope Residue: C 3
Epitope Residue: C 4
Epitope Residue: C 5
Epitope Residue: C 6
Epitope Residue: C 7

# PETEI requires 3 resource files: a CHARMM topology file, a CHARMM parameter
# file, and a file of Lazaridis-Karplus implicit solvation parameters. The LK 
# parameter file is included in the distribution of PETEI in /resources/ but you
# must provide your own copies of the CHARMM topology and parameter files
CHARMM Topology File: ./resources/top_all36_prot.rtf
CHARMM Parameter File: ./resources/par_all36_prot.prm
LK Solvation File: ./resources/solvation.dat
