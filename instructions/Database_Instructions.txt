# Lines that start with '#' are treated as comments by the parser and ignored.
# Blank lines are also ignored. Each command has a key phrase separated from the

# Instruction files are provided to Database_Maker.py as command-line arguments.

# General Information

# The User is who is doing the calculations. 
User: Robert Pantazes of Auburn University

# Name is the name of the database that is being created. It must be a unique
# name in the databases folder. If a database with that name already exists, the 
# program will terminate
Name: 1TTGu

# Information for assessing the framework protein(s)

# PETEI was envisioned as using the results of Molecular Dynamics simulations to 
# understand the flexibility of the attachment points of the binding loops. The 
# name of this instruction is a hold-over from that time. While PETEI could
# still use this information, the quality of results has never been tested and 
# doing so is NOT recommended.
# PETEI will load ALL files from the specified MD folder. Place your file of
# interest in a folder by itself. The structure must have all atoms, including 
# hydrogens.
MD Folder: ./structures/1TTG/fibronectin/

# Atom Pair information is which pairs of atoms to check distance information 
# for. It is recommended that you include these 7 lines verbatim and not make
# any changes to them.
Atom Pair: CA CA
Atom Pair: N N
Atom Pair: C C
Atom Pair: CB CB
Atom Pair: CA CB
Atom Pair: CB CA
Atom Pair: O O

# Binding Loop specifies a portion of the protein framework that is being 
# replaced in the search. It contains 4 pieces of information: a unique name
# (e.g., H1), the chain of the protein in the PDB file(s) in the MD folder,
# the starting residue of the loop, and the ending residue of the loop.
Binding Loop: H1 A 22 30
Binding Loop: H2 A 51 55
Binding Loop: H3 A 76 87

# Information for searching PDB structures for binding loops

# The PDB File List is the file that contains a list of PDB files to search for 
# loops. Each row in the file must contain two entries: the name of a file to
# analyze and the folder in which it is located.
PDB File List: ./structures/1TTG/database_file_list.txt

# Loop Lengths are the minimum and maximum acceptable lengths of the binding
# loops
Loop Lengths: 3 11

# PETEI searches for up to the Maximum Structures for each binding loop as it
# finds possible binding loops. If it exceeds this number, it discards those
# that fit the attachment points least well.
Maximum Structures: 1000

# PETEI needs 3 resource files: CHARMM Topology, CHARMM Parameter, and
# Lazaridis-Karplus implicit solvation. The LK solvation file is included in 
# /resources/, but you have to provide your own copies of the CHARMM topology 
# and parameter files
CHARMM Topology File: ./resources/top_all36_prot.rtf
CHARMM Parameter File: ./resources/par_all36_prot.prm
LK Solvation File: ./resources/solvation.dat

# Information for clustering binding loop structures. This information does not
# effect the database of binding loops created in any way, but does effect the
# summary analysis of their similarities.
Clustering RMSD Max: 1.5
