# PETEI
Proteins Engineered with Targeted Exceptional Interactions (PETEI) is a binding protein design algorithm suitable for designing proteins that bind target molecules using loops, such as antibodies and 10th Type III Fibronectin domains. It was created by the PROTEIN PANT(z) Lab at Auburn University, led by Dr. Robert Pantazes.
